               <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic human pathogen for which new antimicrobial drug options are urgently sought. <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> disulfide-bond protein A1 (PaDsbA1) plays a pivotal role in catalyzing the oxidative folding of multiple virulence proteins and as such holds great promise as a drug target. As part of a fragment-based lead discovery approach to PaDsbA1 inhibitor development, the identification of a crystal form of PaDsbA1 that was more suitable for fragment-soaking experiments was sought. A previously identified crystallization condition for this protein was unsuitable, as in this crystal form of PaDsbA1 the active-site surface loops are engaged in the crystal packing, occluding access to the target site. A single residue involved in crystal-packing interactions was substituted with an amino acid commonly found at this position in closely related enzymes, and this variant was successfully used to generate a new crystal form of PaDsbA1 in which the active-site surface is more accessible for soaking experiments. The PaDsbA1 variant displays identical redox character and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> activity to wild-type PaDsbA1 and is structurally highly similar. Two crystal structures of the PaDsbA1 variant were determined in complex with small molecules bound to the protein active site. These small molecules (MES, glycerol and ethylene glycol) were derived from the crystallization or cryoprotectant solutions and provide a proof of principle that the reported crystal form will be amenable to co-crystallization and soaking with small molecules designed to target the protein active-site surface.</p>

         <title>Introduction &#160; </title>
         <p>Disulfide-bond (DSB) proteins are bacterial oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyze the folding of disulfide bonds in unfolded or partially folded protein substrates. The primary oxidase is DsbA, which typically employs a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (C<italic toggle="yes">XX</italic>C) active-site motif to catalyze a series of thiol-exchange reactions that ultimately oxidize reduced protein substrates. DsbA is itself maintained in an active state by interactions with a partner redox membrane protein (DsbB). DsbA substrates include many structural and secreted virulence effector proteins, and there is now overwhelming evidence that the DSB machinery plays a vital role in the pathogenicity of Proteobacteria (Heras <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"/>); deletion of DsbA prevents lethal bacterial infection <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and has pleiotropic effects upon virulence (Ireland <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"/>; Totsika <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"/>). In the multidrug-resistant and opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, deletion of DsbA impairs the secretion and activity of a number of virulence effector proteins (Braun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb4"/>; Dacheux <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"/>; Ha <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"/>) and disrupts bacterial motility (Ha <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"/>; Urban <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb28"/>). As a consequence of its role in the activity of multiple downstream effector proteins, <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> DsbA (PaDsbA1) is a promising target for inhibition and hence novel antimicrobial development.</p>
         <p>Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) approaches offer an efficient way to identify small-molecule binders that can subsequently be elaborated or linked to generate eventual drug-like compounds (Erlanson, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"/>). Indeed, the approach has recently led to the design of early-stage inhibitors of <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> DsbA (Adams <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"/>). Highly advantageous for the iterative progression from hit to lead in such an FBLD campaign is high-resolution structural information about target&#8211;compound interactions to inform rational medicinal chemistry efforts.</p>
         <p>The crystal structure of PaDsbA1 has previously been determined to 1.5&#8197;&#197; resolution (Shouldice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"/>). However, inspection of the crystal packing revealed that a network of interactions, in particular a salt bridge, engages the active-site surface in a tightly packed crystal lattice inter&#173;action. This interaction may occlude access of ligands to the active site in crystal-soaking experiments, thereby impeding the determination of protein&#8211;fragment complex crystals; indeed, our efforts to use this crystal form for fragment-soaking experiments did not result in any protein&#8211;fragment structures (data not shown). To break this salt bridge, we replaced a single amino acid (Glu82) with a residue commonly found at this position in closely related enzymes and obtained crystals in a new space group with altered crystal packing and increased solvent-channel access to the target site. This variant of PaDsbA1 is biochemically and structurally very similar to wild-type PaDsbA1, with conformational changes confined to the N-terminal end of helix 3. Furthermore, structures of the PaDsbA1 variant were determined in complex with multiple small molecules bound on its active-site surface, one from the crystallization condition and two from cryoprotectant solutions, providing proof of principle that in the new crystal form the active-site face is accessible to compounds introduced <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> soaking or co-crystallization.</p>

            <title>Site-directed mutagenesis &#160; </title>
            <p>Glu82 of PaDsbA1 forms an ionic interaction with an active-site residue in the reported crystal structure. The amino-acid sequence of PaDsbA1 (UniProt ID P0C2B2) was aligned with homologues from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Vibrio cholerae</italic> using <italic toggle="yes">ClustalW</italic>2 to identify residues to replace Glu82. Inspection of the resulting alignment identified that hydrophobic aliphatic side chains (Ile and Met) were found at positions equivalent to Glu82 of PaDsbA1. Subsequently, a single point mutation (Glu82 to Ile, hereafter referred to as E82I PaDsbA1) was introduced using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Two complementary primers (5&#8242;-CAG ATG TTT CTG ACA CTG ATA AGT ATG GGC GTA GAA C-3&#8242; and 5&#8242;-GTT CTA CGC CCA TAC TTA TCA GTG TCA GAA ACA TCT G-3&#8242;) containing the desired isoleucine mutation and designed to anneal to opposite strands of the template vector were synthesized (GeneWorks, Australia). A 25&#8197;&#181;l reaction containing 10&#8197;ng double-stranded parental vector, 5&#8197;&#181;<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> of each primer, 1&#8197;m<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> dNTP and 0.5&#8197;&#181;l <italic toggle="yes">PfuTurbo</italic> DNA polymerase (Pacific Laboratory Products, Australia) was subjected to 25 thermal cycles (95&#176;C for 50&#8197;s, 56&#176;C for 60&#8197;s and 68&#176;C for 9&#8197;min) with a final extension of 10&#8197;min at 68&#176;C. The parental vector was subsequently digested with 20 units of DpnI (New England BioLabs) at 37&#176;C for 1&#8197;h and the resulting product was used to transform competent TOP10 <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells. The introduced mutation was confirmed by sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Australia).</p>

            <p>The redox potentials of WT and E82I PaDsbA1 were determined fluorometrically by exploiting the redox-state-dependent changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of a tryptophan residue close to the catalytic disulfide bridge. Oxidized PaDsbA1 samples were prepared by incubation with a molar excess of oxidized glutathione, which was subsequently removed using an NAP-5 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The redox state of the protein was confirmed by an Ellman assay (Ellman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1961<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"/>).

Oxidation of the peptide substrate can be followed by measuring the fluorescence emission intensity of europium after specific MCA excitation.

            <title>Protein engineering disrupts an active-site-mediated crystal-packing interaction &#160; </title>
            <p>The active-site surface of DsbA enzymes is composed of a C<italic toggle="yes">XX</italic>C motif located at the N-terminal end of H1 in the thioredoxin domain and three additional loop regions (L1, linking &#946;3 and H2; L2, linking H6 and &#946;4 (the <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-Pro loop of the thioredoxin fold; Martin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1993<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb20"/>); and L3, linking &#946;5 and H7, described in McMahon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"/>), which together generate the redox-active site of the enzyme and form the surface for engagement with substrate and partner proteins.</p>
            <p>Inspection of the crystal packing of the 1.5&#8197;&#197; resolution WT PaDsbA1 (Shouldice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"/>; PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=3h93">3h93</ext-link>) crystal structure revealed that a number of intermolecular inter&#173;actions engage the active-site surface in crystal lattice contacts; in particular, a salt bridge (2.88&#8197;&#197;) between His39 of the active-site Cys-His-Pro-Cys motif and Glu82 of a symmetry-related mate and a hydrogen-bonding interaction (3.25&#8197;&#197;) between the backbone N atom of Val153 (L3) and the carboxyl O atom of a Ser83 symmetry mate. Together, these result in a surface packing that may impede small-molecule access to the active site during crystal soaking experiments. Screening of alternative crystallization conditions using WT PaDsbA1 yielded crystals of different space groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>4 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>4<sub>1</sub> with two molecules in the asymmetric unit) but did not break the primary His39&#8211;Glu82<sub>sym</sub> crystal contact (data not shown).</p>
            <p>To break the critical salt bridge, we employed site-directed mutagenesis, replacing Glu82 with isoleucine. We selected isoleucine for two reasons: firstly, its uncharged side chain cannot engage in electrostatic contacts and, secondly, isoleucine is found at this position in the closely related enzymes <italic toggle="yes">V. cholerae</italic> DsbA and <italic toggle="yes">K. pneumoniae</italic> DsbA (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>
               <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>) and substitution was therefore anticipated to have a minimal effect on both protein structure and function. We subsequently obtained crystals of the E82I PaDsbA1 variant in a new space group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>, one molecule in the asymmetric unit). The structure of the E82I PaDsbA1 variant (crystal 1) was determined to 1.9&#8197;&#197; resolution with an <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> factor of 15.9% (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

Details of data collection, solution methods and additional indicators of the quality of the final model are given in Tables 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"/> and 2<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2"/>.

In the new packing configuration, no protein interactions are formed to His39 (Table 3<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3"/>). Furthermore, relative to the WT PaDsbA1 crystals, fewer atoms of the active-site surface loops of the E82I PaDsbA1 variant are engaged in crystal contacts with protein molecules of neighbouring symmetry-related molecules (Figs. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>

            <p>Superposition of WT and E82I PaDsbA1 indicates a high degree of global structural similarity (r.m.s.d. of 0.94&#8197;&#197; between 180 equivalent C<sup>&#945;</sup> atoms; Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>

            <p>As a direct result of the engineered amino-acid substitution, the WT PaDsbA1 and E82I PaDsbA1 structures differ in the conformation of their H2&#8211;H3 connecting loop (Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>). Relative to WT PaDsbA1, a rearranged network of hydrogen bonding in E82I PaDsbA1 maintains the stabilization of particular H3 side chains but introduces both a kink and an additional partial helical turn to the N-terminal region of H3 (Figs. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>
               <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> and 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>
               <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>). Specifically, in WT PaDsbA1 Glu82 forms a side-chain-mediated hydrogen bond to the N<sup>&#8714;2</sup> atom of the imidazole ring of His91. WT PaDsbA1 His91 is also involved in an additional side-chain contact (<italic toggle="yes">via</italic> its N<sup>&#948;1</sup> atom) to the hydroxyl group of the neighbouring Tyr35 (Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>
               <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). In E82I PaDsbA1, where the nonpolar aliphatic Ile side chain replaces Glu82, this Glu82-specific stabilization of His91 is lost, and His91 is instead stabilized by side-chain-mediated hydrogen bonds to Glu44 and Glu87 (Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>
               <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>). Furthermore, the side chain of His91 is flipped relative to its orientation in the wild-type protein (Figs. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>

               <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>). Glu44 is similarly positioned in both proteins, but in contrast Glu87 undergoes a significant repositioning in the E82I PaDsbA1 variant to mediate contact with His91; in this new orientation Glu87 is also suitably positioned to recapitulate a hydrogen bond to the Tyr35 hydroxyl group previously mediated by His91&#8197;N<sup>&#948;1</sup>. The overall effect of this altered hydrogen-bond network and the repositioning of Glu87 (Figs. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>

               <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>) is the introduction of a partial helical turn in H3 as a new main-chain helical hydrogen bond forms between His91 and Glu87. This N-terminal section of H3 forms part of the boundary of a groove on the posterior face of PaDsbA1 (Shouldice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"/>); comparison of WT and E82I PaDsbA1 indicate that the posterior groove of both proteins is essentially unchanged.</p>

In all, we determined the crystal structures of E82I PaDsbA1 cryoprotected with 40% PEG 400 (crystal 1, Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"/>, PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4zl7">4zl7</ext-link>), 20% glycerol (crystal 2, Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"/>, PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4zl8">4zl8</ext-link>) and 20% ethylene glycol (crystal 3, Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"/>, PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4zl9">4zl9</ext-link>). All three structures were determined at high resolution (in the range 1.4&#8211;1.9&#8197;&#197;) and were of comparable quality, although we note that the glycerol-cryoprotected crystals yielded the highest resolution diffraction data (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"/>).</p>

               <title>E82I PaDsbA1 can bind PEG molecules on its noncatalytic surface &#160; </title>
               <p>A molecule of hexaethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol, PEG 400), which was used as a cryoprotectant during crystal cryocooling, is found in the electron-density map of E82I PaDsbA1 crystal 1. PEG 400 is bound at the C-terminal end of H1 (Fig. 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"/>
                  <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>). The molecule adopts a horseshoe configuration encircling the side chain of Lys53 (Fig. 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"/>
                  <italic toggle="yes">b</italic>). Electron density is sharply resolved for the majority of the molecule, where it is in closest proximity to Lys53, but is poorly resolved for the first two ethylene glycol monomer units of the molecule (Fig. 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"/>
                  <italic toggle="yes">b</italic>); accordingly, atoms O1&#8211;C5 inclusive have elevated <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> factors with respect to the rest of the non-H atoms of the bound PEG 400. Two O atoms of PEG 400 make hydrogen-bonded contacts to Lys53&#8197;NZ: O10 and O16 (distances of 2.87 and 3.05&#8197;&#197;, respectively). PEG 400 makes additional contacts to Pro49, Trp50, Leu54 and Pro55 of H1 and Asp180 of H7.</p>
               <p>We note that PEG 400 binds in a similar vicinity to that of a glycerol molecule (Glyc-3) resolved in the structure of WT PaDsbA1 (Shouldice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"/>); in this structure Glyc-3 is positioned towards the C-terminal end of H1 between H1 and H7 within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chains of H7 residues Asp180 and Arg187. As noted previously, this area is rich in acidic and basic residues (Shouldice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"/>), and in crystal 3 (current study) a further PEG molecule from the crystallization condition can also be resolved near Asp187 and Glu184 of H7.</p>

               <title>E82I PaDsbA1 binds several small molecules at its active site &#160; </title>
               <p>E82I PaDsbA1 can also bind several small molecules directly on the catalytic face of the protein. In the crystal structures of the E82I PaDsbA1 variant cryocooled with either glycerol (crystal 2) or ethylene glycol (crystal 3), His39 in the active site makes electrostatic and hydrogen-bond contacts with a molecule of the respective cryoprotectant and also a molecule of 2-(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES). MES, which is presumably derived from the crystallization condition common to all three crystals, is not resolved in crystal 1, where His39 makes no apparent contacts to a component of the mother liquor or cryoprotectant.</p>
               <p>In crystals 2 and 3, the orientation of the His39 imidazole ring is rotated relative to its position in the WT PaDsbA1 and PEG 400 cryocooled structures (crystal 1, present work; Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"/>). It has been observed previously that the active-site histidine in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> DsbA can adopt a number of positions depending on the crystal form and the protein redox state (Guddat <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"/>). We suggest that in this case the observed reorientation of His39 is a direct consequence of glycerol or ethylene glycol binding, and that this in turn brings His39 into an orientation that is permissive for a stable interaction with MES.</p>
               <p>The bound molecules of MES and cryoprotectant (glycerol or ethylene glycol) are each involved in numerous side-chain-mediated and main-chain-mediated hydrogen-bond inter&#173;actions with residues of the active-site surface loops (CPHC loop, <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-Pro L2 and L3; Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"/>). In crystal 2, three molecules (two glycerols and one MES) decorate the active-site loops, variously contacting Cys37, Pro38 and His39 (CPHC), Thr151, Gly152 and Val163 (cisPro L2), and Ile166 and Gly167 (L3) (Figs. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"/>

                  <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). Together, this provides a serendipitous proof of principle that in the engineered E82I PaDsbA1 variant the active site is available to small molecules that are both present during crystallization (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> MES) and introduced <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> soaking (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> cryoprotectant glycerol).</p>

         <title>Conclusion &#160; </title>
         <p>
            <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections (Rosenthal <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"/>). In the USA, 13% of severe nosocomial <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> infections are multidrug-resistant, meaning that all or nearly all currently available antibiotics are ineffective as treatments (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"/>). &#8216;Prompt and sustained action&#8217; including the development of new drugs is required to counter, and prevent the escalation of, the threat to public health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"/>). DsbA is essential for multiple facets of <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence and is a highly promising target for new drug development. DsbA inhibitors would disrupt bacterial virulence rather than growth, serving as potent anti-infectives whilst exerting a reduced selection pressure to develop resistance (Heras <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"/>).</p>
         <p>WT PaDsbA1 did not give crystals that were amenable for use in a fragment-screening approach. Here, we have generated a variant of PaDsbA1 to disrupt an active-site residue-mediated crystal contact. Whilst there are localized conformational changes to the N-terminal end of H3 of the variant protein E82I PaDsbA1, the active-site surface of the protein (CPHC, L1, <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-Pro L2 and L3) is unchanged, and crucially the protein activity and redox character are essentially identical to those of the wild type. In the identified crystal form of E82I PaDsbA1, the active-site region can simultaneously bind multiple ligands derived from the crystallization condition and cryoprotectant solution, indicating that the new crystal form is suitable for use in subsequent FBLD campaigns to characterize small-molecule binders of this important mediator of bacterial virulence.</p>
         <p>In the early stages of fragment-based lead discovery campaigns, hit fragments typically exhibit low-affinity binding to their target. This presents an inherent challenge to obtaining protein&#8211;fragment crystal structures, in which a high occupancy of fragment in the crystal at the binding site is essential to resolve the corresponding electron density. It follows that to maximize the chances of successful soaking experiments one should avoid the potential for competition from other molecules that may also bind at the target site in the crystal. For this reason, we suggest that crystal 1 is the most suitable for subsequent structural and fragment-based lead discovery experiments, as either glycerol or ethylene glycol may directly or indirectly compete for fragment binding in this region.</p>
